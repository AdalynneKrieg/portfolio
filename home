        <p>
            Hello, my name is Ady Krieg and I am an aspiring 17 year old artist. I've created this website as an easily accessible way to introduce others </br>
            to my work as I seek out new opportunities and friends within the tattoo artistry community! </br>
  </br>
    I am a part of the 2024-2025 AP Art program at Forest Hills Northern. This opportunity has provided me with a lot of one-on-one time with a talented mentor, </br>
     my teacher Mrs. St Antoine.Her direction and my own creativity and passion for art have helped immensely with improving my skill and understanding of art. </br>
  </br>
      I am looking for any and all advice, suggestions, connections and mentors, so please feel free to reach out
