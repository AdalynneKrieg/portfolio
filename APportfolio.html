      <p>trauma bonds and my experiences</p>

    <div class="box">
      <p>For my sustained investigation, I want to explore a specific time in my 
         life that is difficult for me to recall because of the trauma I experienced.
         To defend itself, my brain has blocked out large portions of my memory from 
         my time spent across the country in an eating disorder clinic. In a desperate
         attempt to remember and find the good in such a scarring experience, I am 
         going to visually depict as much as I can remember, in as much detail as
         possible, with help from a close friend I made while there. As I plan 
         and complete this sustained investigation, with every step of the process
         I will be asking myself what happened, and how did it affect me and 
         the others who also experienced it?</p>
